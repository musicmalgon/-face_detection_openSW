# This is Readme for dev.
  If other team need to know something, write it down here. Also please notice it on kakao talk.  
  There are 3 branchs for our project.
  - main : main branch for final program. DO NOT COMMIT HERE. It only needs to be updated by merging. However, updating README.md will be directly commited on main.
  - develop : develop branch for developing. Merge your feature branch here.
  - feature : Developing is mainly done here. Make the feature. When finished, merge it to develop branch  
  
  **We do not use realse or hotfix branch.** This is not realsed one. So we don't need it. If we need somthing to fix, it will be done in develop branch.
